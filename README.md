Safety Analysis in Australian Cities

This open-source project investigates crash risk patterns and injury severity associated with e-scooter usage across selected Australian cities.

## 🚦 Project Objective

To identify critical risk zones, understand crash causes, and provide policy recommendations for safer micromobility infrastructure.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- Crash frequency and injury severity
- Time and location patterns (spatial-temporal analysis)
- Impact of road conditions and weather
- Policy recommendations for safer micromobility

## 📊 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium, Seaborn)
- QGIS / Kepler.gl
- Jupyter Notebook
- Open data from [Data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au) and VicRoads

## 🗃️ Dataset Sources

- VicRoads CrashStats (VIC)
- Transport for NSW Open Data Hub
- Weather data from Australian Bureau of Meteorology

## 📈 Outputs

- Crash hotspots heatmap
- Injury severity prediction using logistic regression
- Time-based accident distribution (rush hours, weekends)
- Visual dashboard (optional)

## 📄 Methods

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
2. **Geo-Analysis (Spatial Join, Hotspot Mapping)**
3. **Injury Severity Classification**
4. **Machine Learning Model (optional)**

## 📍 Policy Implications

This project can help urban planners:
- Optimize e-scooter regulations
- Identify high-risk areas
- Enhance infrastructure design for micromobility users
